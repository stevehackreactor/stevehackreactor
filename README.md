### Hi there 👋,

I'm Steve Gackstetter (he/him) and I'm a passionate, innovative Full-Stack Engineer with an uncommon love for complex algorithms. 🚀 I am versed in assembling React, Express, Node.js, and MongoDB applications but am not limited to this stack. I am fulfilled by learning every day which pairs nicely with being a Software Developer.

I have a high curiosity for the algorithms that make life easier for people. I love that we can automate things like facial recognition, complex data analysis, and environmental health tracking. Working on the algorithms that make services like these possible is a calling for me and working to have an impact on the lives of millions is what gets me out of bed in the morning. ☕
